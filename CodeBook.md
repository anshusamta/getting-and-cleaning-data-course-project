Here is a brief list and explanation of the variables and funtions found in the r-script and final text file. 

CODE VARIABLES
-  "features": list of all features.
- "meanAndStdIndexes": list of the indexes of the means and standard deviations in the features vector
- "training": contains the training data as well as subject and activity ids
- "test": contains the test data as well as subject and activity ids
- "mergedData": contains both the test and training data with subject ids and activity labels
- "secondData": means of aggregrated data with respect to "Subject" and "Activity". 

TRANSFORMATIONS IN CODE
- "rbind" and "cbind" were used to merge data
- "sapply" was used to translate activity ids to plain English
- "aggregate" was used to group data with respect to "Subject" and "Activity"

VARIABLES IN THE TEXT FILE "tidySet"
- "Subject": the id of the test subject
- "Activity": the activity performed by the test subject
- Measurement variables
